## Installation Guide For Project Elixir on M31

## First Time Install / Clean Flash from Another ROM

1. Ensure you're using TWRP (Keep in mind, ROM is encrypted!) or LineageOS Recovery
2. Ensure you're coming from January stock!
3. Go to Recovery Mode
4. Flash the ROM (either via ADB Sideload or Flash from sd
5. FORMAT DATA (via yes if in TWRP) and ignore any error
6. Reboot to System

### Note: 
- If you are coming from A12 to A13 clean flash is compulsory
- There are several bugs: NFC, Carrier Aggregation and offline charging are broken, and of course, VoLTE is broken too, thanks to Samsung
- NFC will be fixed with June!
