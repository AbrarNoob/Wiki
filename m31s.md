## Installation Guide For Project Elixir on M31s

## First Time Install / Clean Flash from Another ROM

1. Ensure you're using TWRP (Keep in mind, ROM is encrypted!) or LineageOS Recovery
2. Ensure you're coming from latest A12 stock (Shouldn't be June security patch!)
3. Go to Recovery Mode
4. Flash the ROM (either via ADB Sideload or Flash from sd
5. FORMAT DATA (via yes if in TWRP) and ignore any error
6. Reboot to System

### Note: 
- If you are coming from A12 to A13 clean flash is compulsory
- There are several bugs: offline charging is broken, and of course, VoLTE is broken too, thanks to Samsung
